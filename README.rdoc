== Install

  bundle install
  rake db:setup
  rails s

== Flaws

The code has a really weird flaw:

When we submit the form for the first time, it doesn't fire the js as it is supposed to

  $(document).ready(function() {
    $('.filter form').submit(function() {
      startGrid();
      return false;
    });
  });

This code (return false;) should STOP the submit action, but it does not stop it the first time, you have to submit two times.
I didn't had enough time to check why it happens.
